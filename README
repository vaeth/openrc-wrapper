openrc-wrapper - using some openrc scripts with systemd and other init systems

This script has been splitted from the squash_dir project
	https://github.com/vaeth/squash_dir/
because the latter project has essentially been replaced by squashmount
	https://github.com/vaeth/squashmount/
except for the openrc-wraper which is of independent interest and which
will be further developed only here - the version in squash_dir is frozen.
Moreover, some independent systemd init-scripts are provided here.

openrc-wrapper works only for relatively simple openrc initscripts:
If the initscripts are simple enough, openrc-wrapper might even be able to
start/stop them even if openrc is not installed at all (although the
output might look better if openrc is installed).

The usage is extremely simple: If you have an openrc init script
	/etc/init.d/SERVICE
possibly with a configuration file
	/etc/conf.d/SERVICE
you just start/stop this service by calling
	/usr/bin/openrc-wrapper SERVICE start
or
	/usr/bin/openrc-wrapper SERVICE stop
respectively. Note that this does not really start/stop the service in the
sense of openrc but just executes the corresponding function of the
initscript (in an environment which somewhat emulates the openrc environment).
In addition, if the openrc init script registered additional COMMANDS like
store/restore/... you can also use:
	openrc-wrapper SERVICE COMMAND

Example usage from the command line:
	openrc-wrapper alsasound save
and
	openrc-wrapper alsasound restore

A typical systemd service using an openrc initscript will contain
	ExecStart=/usr/bin/openrc-wrapper SERVICE start
and possibly also
	ExecStop=/usr/bin/openrc-wrapper SERVICE stop
Some examples are in the provided systemd/system folder.

For installation just copy bin/* into /usr/bin and,
at your discretion, the provided systemd initscripts systemd/system/*
into your systemd system folder. In order to get completion for zsh, also copy
zsh/_openrc-wrapper somewher into you your zsh's $fpath.
Thus, a typical manual installation looks like this
(after you did 'cd' into the project's directory):
	cp bin/* /usr/bin
	cp systemd/system/* /usr/lib/systemd/system
	cp zsh/* /usr/share/zsh/site-functions
(For gentoo there is an ebuild which does this in the mv overlay).
